/**
 * An experimental package for testing possible improvements to the command handling
 * mechanism built-in to the CCS core. This package as been separated off to allow
 * us to rapidly prototype ideas for how the command package can be improved, along the
 * lines discussed in <A href="https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/x/vcYSC">this confluence page</a>
 * and the confluence <a href="https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/x/NwApC">discussion on 
 * annotations</a>.
 * <p>
 * This work is strongly based on earlier ideas developed by Stuart and Max, using <a href="https://code.google.com/p/cliche/">cliche</a>
 * as a simple command shell. Although cliche has been removed from this implementation in favour of 
 * custom classes more directly tuned to the CCS requirements the ideas developed in the earlier
 * prototypes remain.
